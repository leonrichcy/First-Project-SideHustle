# First-Project-SideHustle
Capstone Group 26, First Project
Our task is to build out the project to the designs inside the /design folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use our best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin. This should help train our eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the /images folder.
